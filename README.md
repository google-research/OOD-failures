# Experiments

The code in `experiments.ipynb` allows you to interactively run experiments from Appendix E.
These are experiments demonstrating the effects of geometric skews and statistical skews in a real-world dataset
in the context of a max-margin classifier and a gradient-descent-trained linear classifier.
